# Rachael Mahon

If you're looking for a full-stack junior developer who loves problem solving, is very comfortable with Ruby and Javascript frameworks, is a great communicator, takes ownership of a project, is creative and has a good sense of humour; then I'm your woman.

My website hosts a number of projects that will give you an idea about the type of developer and person I am. The ones I am most proud of are:

| What Tights? | An algorithm for determining the denier of tights required | Available in both Javascript and Ruby|[Link](https://github.com/RachaelMahon/What-Tights)|

I'm looking for an environment that let's me bring my whole self to work, challenges me and supports my continued learning. I'm happiest when I'm building stuff, thinking about complex tech issues and working with people who are also excited about what we do.

## Why I am a coder now

I've been excited about learning to code for years (as evidenced by the facebook app I made and forgot about 4 years ago) and taught myself what I needed to know for personal projects. The projects I wanted to complete motivated me to pick up exactly what I needed to to finish them. I taught myself GIMP to manipulate images for ridiculing my friends. I learned a lot about 3d printing to 3d print a topographically accurate moon from lunar data from a model given to me by the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Valencia. It remains the most beautiful object I've ever owned. I've reached the front page of reddit with an LED project I made for a friend's birthday. Consistently, I am motivated by projects I want to see realised and whatever tech I need to learn to do that, is an afterthought. If it can be done, I'm confident that with enough work and time, I can do it.

## Who was I before I became a coder

My background relates to Law and Children's Social Care. I got into these areas because everyday, I made people's lives better using by problem solving.

My first job out of University was as a criminal paralegal of a tiny law firm in Dublin. It was one of the most fantastic experiences of my life. For a year, I went to work everyday and fire fought problems left right and centre, in prisons, in court, in the office. It was so much fun, emotionally and intellectually stimulating and honed my crisis situation skills to a tee. I left to move to the UK and for greener pastures. I loved criminal law but it's exceptionally socially draining and once my year was up I wanted a slightly slower pace to deep dive on problems. That's why I moved into Child Protection Law.

Working in Child Protection has been deeply fulfilling. It allowed me to approach more systematic problems through data analysis and policy consideration rather than on a case by case basis. I have a passion for small tweaks that make big impacts and being able to see these in action and prove the benefits with data motivated deeper research. Here, I learned the power of the deep dive and the novel approach.
